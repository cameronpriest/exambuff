<h2>Exam skills</h2>
<p>Exam skills are vital for success in your degree. Most UK undergraduates will rely on exam performance for the majority of their mark. Without the ability to expertly deal with examinations, you will not do yourself or your revision justice. </p>
<p>Few students, however, develop the skills needed to do themselves justice in exams. Exam writing is very different from coursework: you will be under pressure, writing from memory without feedback or advice. You need to have excellent structure, planning, timing and writing. The act of writing by hand for a long stretch will present its own challenges, especially as you have typed your coursework.</p>

You will complete examinations exactly as you do in exams: by hand, under pressure.
