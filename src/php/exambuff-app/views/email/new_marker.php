You'll need to complete an assessment and confirm your PhD status as the next step of your application. We'll review your application within one to two working days.

Before you take the asssessment read our marking tutorial here: www.exambuff.co.uk/marker/info/markingtutorial.

If you are successful in your application, you'll be able to request payment for the assessment at the normal rate.

Thanks for your interest so far,
