<p>If you are a current or past PhD student we'd love to have you as one of our tutors. We think working for us as a tutor is great because:</p>
<ul class="ticks">
	<li>You can do it from home - no unpaid commuting</li>
	<li>Whenever you like - fits around your research demands</li>
	<li>For as long as you like</li>
	<li>Good for academic CVs</li>
	<li>We pay well!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to apply, please write to recruitment [at] exambuff.co.uk, including your C.V and a covering letter detailing your suitability for tutoring. We interview new tutors, and if your application is successful you'll need to provide evidence of your PhD status, as either a current or past PhD student.</p>
