<h2>What feedback will you get from markers?</h2>
<p>We think what students really want to know is how to get better, not where they've gone wrong. That's why our tutors give you practical examples of how you could have improved your answer.</p>
<p><div class="img left">
<?=withCaption($this->config->item('base_url').'/img/inline-marking.png',
"Our inline marking system allows you to see precisely where to improve");?>
</div>Your answers are read using our marking application, which allows our tutors to highlight specific areas of your text. These comments can in turn be linked to the targets they'll give you, so you'll be able to see exactly what aspects of your writing needed improvement.</p>
<p>In addition, you'll get a classification for your current exam-skill standard, using the standard degree classification system. This will allow you to track your progress.</p>
