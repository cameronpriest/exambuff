<h2>Uploading an image to Exambuff</h2>
<p>When uploading images of your essay, you need to ensure they are of a high enough quality for our tutors to be able to read them. </p>
<h3>Megapixels</h3>
<p>Megapixels refer to the number of pixels in an image. Each megapixel is one million pixels. To calculate the number of pixels in an image multiply the width and height in pixels – for instance, 1280 * 10000000 = 1,310,720, or 1.3 megapixels.</p>
<p>Exambuff scales down images 2 megapixels, so this is this highest quality you’ll need. Most digital cameras or scanners should be able capture an image of this size, but check that it is set up to do so.</p>
<h3>Image Quality</h3>
<p>Digital images saved as JPEG files are compressed, meaning they do not contain all of the original detail captured by the camera. 
<p>You need to ensure that your handwriting is still visible after compression. For this reason, set your camera’s quality settings to high, or save scanned images as good quality JPEGs. Try to read the image of your essay on screen before you upload it.</p>
